    <li>Writing letters</li>
   <pre>
   Write a letter to a senior this Valentines day! 
   You can write a letter to a member of the seniors home and actually receive volunteer hours for it. 
   This is an excellent way to practice your letter writing skills. 
   Let them know that you are a member of UIS Leadership Club and that you and everyone at UIS wishes them an amazing and loving Valentines Day :)
